# SkyChart
This is a simple Python app that allows you to see the positions of the stars in the sky at any given moment and from any location. It makes use of the Astropy library for calculating the horizontal coordinates of the stars given the coordinates and the time. The equatorial coordinates are taken from the Hipparcos Catalogue stored in the hyp_data.dat file. The Nominatim API from Geopy is used to get the coordinates of a place from a string given by the user. The pyQt5 framework is used for the UI and Matplotlib generates the graph.
